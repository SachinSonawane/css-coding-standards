CSS Coding Standards
====================

CSS Coding Standards you must conform to when writing CSS in XHTMLized projects.

## Terminology

Concise terminology used in these standards:

```css
selector {
	property: value;
}
```

property: value makes a *declaration*. Selector and declarations makes a *rule*.
